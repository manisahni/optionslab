# AI Assistant Improvements Summary

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Changed Agent Type
- Switched from `OPENAI_FUNCTIONS` to `ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION`
- This agent type works better with local LLMs

### 2. Enhanced System Prompt
- Added explicit instructions to execute code
- Emphasized returning numerical results

### 3. Automatic Code Execution
- **NEW**: If AI returns only code, the system automatically executes it
- Captures print statements and variable values
- Shows results below the code

## How It Works Now

When the AI returns code like:
```python
df['hour'] = df['date'].dt.hour
hourly_vol = df.groupby('hour')['returns'].std()
print(hourly_vol)
```

The system will:
1. Detect the code block
2. Execute it automatically
3. Show the results:

```
ðŸ“Š **Executing the code to show results:**

9     0.0234
10    0.0187
11    0.0156
12    0.0122
13    0.0119
14    0.0134
15    0.0178

âœ… Code executed automatically to show actual results.
```

## Testing Instructions

1. Start the app: `python launch.py --quick`
2. Go to AI Assistant tab
3. Try these queries:

### Test 1: Basic Volatility
```
Calculate the average volatility for each hour of the trading day
```

### Test 2: Conditional Analysis
```
Show me the win rate for trades when RSI is below 30
```

### Test 3: Complex Analysis
```
Calculate the correlation between volume spikes and price movements
```

## Key Features

âœ… Automatic code execution when AI returns only code
âœ… Captures all print outputs
âœ… Shows created variables and their values
âœ… Works with pandas DataFrames
âœ… Error handling if code fails

## If It Still Shows Only Code

The automatic execution wrapper will kick in and run the code for you!
