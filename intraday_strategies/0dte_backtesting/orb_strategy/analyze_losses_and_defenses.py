print("""
Based on the analysis, here are the PRACTICAL defenses:

1. NO STOP LOSS NEEDED ✓
   • With 89% win rate, stops would hurt more than help
   • Most losses are small and manageable
   • Let trades play out to expiration

2. POSITION SIZING (MOST IMPORTANT) ⭐
   • Use Kelly Criterion: ~7% of capital per trade
   • Or safer: 1 contract per $15,000 capital
   • Never increase size after losses

3. TIME FILTERS (OPTIONAL)
   • Consider skipping trades after 2:00 PM
   • Best entries typically before noon
   • Avoid last 30 minutes of trading day

4. MANAGE CONSECUTIVE LOSSES
   • After 2 losses in a row, reduce size by 50%
   • Return to normal size after a win
   • This limits drawdown during bad streaks

5. DELTA HEDGING (ADVANCED)
   • If |net delta| > 0.30, consider hedging
   • Buy/sell SPY shares to neutralize
   • Only for larger accounts ($50K+)

6. VOLATILITY FILTER (MINIMAL IMPACT)
   • Skip if OR > 1.5% (extreme days)
   • Skip if OR < 0.1% (no movement)
   • But data shows minimal improvement

BOTTOM LINE:
• The 89% win rate means defenses hurt more than help
• Focus on CONSISTENT POSITION SIZING
• Accept the 11% losses as cost of edge
• Don't overtrade or revenge trade after losses
