The ORB strategy trades BOTH long and short based on the breakout direction:

1. BULLISH BREAKOUTS (67% of trades):
   • When SPY breaks ABOVE the opening range high
   • We sell PUT credit spreads (bullish position)
   • Profit if SPY stays above our short PUT strike
   
2. BEARISH BREAKOUTS (33% of trades):
   • When SPY breaks BELOW the opening range low
   • We sell CALL credit spreads (bearish position)  
   • Profit if SPY stays below our short CALL strike

KEY INSIGHTS:
• We get 2x more bullish signals (market has upward bias)
• Both directions are profitable (89%+ win rate)
• This is NOT a directional bet - we trade the breakout wherever it goes
• The strategy is MARKET NEUTRAL over time

IMPORTANT: We trade BOTH directions, but only ONE per day!
The first breakout (up or down) determines that day's trade.
