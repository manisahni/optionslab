# Optimization Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive optimizations implemented based on the AI analysis recommendations to resolve the "Bad file descriptor" errors and improve system performance.

## ðŸŽ¯ Critical Issues Addressed

### 1. File Descriptor Limits
**Problem**: System-level resource exhaustion causing "Bad file descriptor" errors
**Solution**: Implemented aggressive caching and file descriptor management

#### Implemented Fixes:

- **Enhanced cache management** with LRU-like behavior and proactive cleanup
- **File blacklisting** for consistently failing files
- **Context managers** for proper file handle cleanup
- **Retry mechanisms** with multiple parquet engines (pyarrow, fastparquet)

### 2. _find_option Function Optimization
**Problem**: Inefficient option lookup causing performance bottlenecks
**Solution**: Added indexing and optimized search algorithms

#### Implemented Fixes:
- **Composite key indexing** for faster option lookups
- **Vectorized operations** for better performance
- **Pre-built index creation** for maximum performance scenarios
- **Consistent date format handling** for both datetime and string formats

### 3. Advanced Exit Management Externalization
**Problem**: Heavy reliance on hardcoded parameters in config.py
**Solution**: Enhanced configuration flexibility

#### Implemented Fixes:
- **YAML-based configuration** for strategy parameters
- **Externalized exit thresholds** in strategy definitions
- **Dynamic parameter loading** from strategy files
- **Unified configuration system** across Traditional and YAML modes
