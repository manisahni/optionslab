# PMCC Sharpe Ratio Optimization Research Summary

## 🎯 Objective
Systematically optimize the Poor Man's Covered Call (PMCC) strategy to maximize Sharpe ratio through advanced enhancement techniques while maintaining realistic execution assumptions.

## 📊 Optimization Framework

### Core Infrastructure
- **Parameterized Backtest Engine**: `PMCCOptimizer` class with configurable parameters
- **Market Timing Filters**: VIX, trend, RSI-based entry/exit conditions
- **Greeks-Based Management**: Delta, theta, vega optimization
- **IV Rank Integration**: Volatility-based position timing
- **Collar Modifications**: Protective put integration
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Automated A/B testing across all enhancements

### Baseline Strategy (Starting Point)
- **LEAP Selection**: 70-85 delta, 600-800 DTE
- **Short Call Selection**: 20-30 delta, 30-45 DTE  
- **Rolling Rules**: 50% profit target OR 21 DTE
- **Commission**: $0.65 per contract
- **Slippage**: 0.5%

## 🔬 Enhancement Strategies Tested

### 1. Market Timing Filters
**VIX Filter**
- Enter when volatility < 25th percentile (cheaper LEAPs)
- Exit when volatility > 35th percentile (assignment risk)

**Trend Filter** 
- Only trade when SPY > 50-day moving average
- Avoid sideways/bear markets

**RSI Filter**
- Trade only when RSI between 30-70 (avoid extremes)
- Momentum-based position timing

**Combined Filters**
- VIX + Trend combination testing
- Multi-factor market regime detection

### 2. Delta Target Optimization
**LEAP Delta Ranges**
- Conservative: 65-75 delta (lower risk, less leverage)
- Baseline: 70-85 delta (current parameters)
- Aggressive: 75-90 delta (higher leverage, more risk)

**Short Call Delta Ranges**
- Conservative: 15-25 delta (further OTM, lower premium)
- Baseline: 20-30 delta (current parameters)  
- Aggressive: 25-35 delta (closer to money, higher premium)

### 3. Greeks-Based Management
**Delta Management**
- LEAP delta bounds (60-95 delta)
- Short call assignment risk (>60 delta buyback)
- Dynamic delta-based rolling

**Theta Optimization**
- Hold short calls longer during acceleration (last 30 days)
- Minimum theta threshold for early exits
- Time decay maximization

**Vega Management**
- LEAP vega exposure limits
- Volatility regime-based position sizing

### 4. IV Rank Integration
**Entry Timing**
- Only sell calls when IV > 30th percentile
- Buy LEAPs when IV < 90th percentile

**Exit Timing**  
- Close positions when IV < 10th percentile
- Volatility contraction exits

### 5. Collar Modifications
**Protective Put Addition**
- 5% downside protection (tight collar)
- 10% downside protection (standard collar)
- Cost/benefit analysis vs naked PMCC

## 📈 Testing Framework

### Data & Period
- **Dataset**: SPY daily EOD options (2023-2024)
- **Capital**: $10,000 initial
- **Execution**: Realistic fills with slippage and commission
- **Validation**: Walk-forward analysis, out-of-sample testing

### Success Metrics
- **Primary**: Sharpe Ratio improvement (target >1.5)
- **Secondary**: Total return maintenance
- **Risk**: Max drawdown <15%
- **Practical**: Trade frequency 50-200/year

### Statistical Approach
- **A/B Testing**: Each enhancement vs baseline
- **Combination Testing**: Multi-factor optimization
- **Robustness**: Multiple market regimes
- **Significance**: Minimum 0.05 Sharpe improvement threshold

## 🏆 Expected Research Outcomes

### Ranking System
1. **🥇 Best Configuration**: Highest Sharpe ratio
2. **🥈 Runner-up**: Second best risk-adjusted return  
3. **🥉 Third Place**: Alternative with different risk profile
4. **Honorable Mentions**: Modest improvements worth considering

### Decision Framework
- **Significant Improvement (>0.1 Sharpe)**: Implement for live trading
- **Moderate Improvement (0.05-0.1)**: Consider with confidence intervals
- **No Improvement (<0.05)**: Baseline remains optimal

## 🎯 Implementation Strategy

### Research Phase (Current)
1. Run comprehensive optimization framework
2. Identify best-performing enhancements
3. Validate results with out-of-sample testing
4. Document optimal parameter combinations

### Validation Phase (Next)
1. Forward test best configurations
2. Monte Carlo simulation of edge cases  
3. Transaction cost sensitivity analysis
4. Market regime robustness testing

### Production Phase (Future)
1. Create production-ready strategy config
2. Build monitoring dashboard for live positions
3. Implement alert system for roll/exit signals
4. Documentation for manual execution

## 📋 Key Research Questions

1. **Which market timing filter provides the best risk-adjusted improvement?**
2. **Are deeper ITM LEAPs or higher delta short calls more effective?**
3. **Does Greeks-based management justify the complexity?**
4. **Can IV rank timing improve entry/exit efficiency?**
5. **Do collar modifications enhance risk-adjusted returns?**
