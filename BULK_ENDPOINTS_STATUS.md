# Bulk Endpoints Testing Status

## Summary

The bulk endpoints have been implemented in the client but testing reveals:

### ✅ Implementation Status
- All 7 bulk endpoints are implemented in the client
- Both async and sync versions are available
- Proper error handling and parameter validation
- Strike price conversion from millidollars to dollars

### ⚠️ Testing Results

1. **Endpoints exist in the Terminal** - They return proper error responses (not 404s)
2. **Currently returning NO_DATA errors** - This could be because:
   - Market is closed (testing on weekend)
   - Bulk data requires a paid subscription
   - Terminal needs to be configured for bulk data
   - Bulk data might need to be cached first

### Bulk Endpoints Implemented

1. `get_bulk_option_quotes()` - `/bulk_snapshot/option/quote`
2. `get_bulk_option_ohlc()` - `/bulk_snapshot/option/ohlc`
3. `get_bulk_option_greeks()` - `/bulk_snapshot/option/greeks`
4. `get_bulk_option_greeks_second_order()` - `/bulk_snapshot/option/greeks_second_order`
5. `get_bulk_option_greeks_third_order()` - `/bulk_snapshot/option/greeks_third_order`
6. `get_bulk_option_all_greeks()` - `/bulk_snapshot/option/all_greeks`
7. `get_bulk_option_open_interest()` - `/bulk_snapshot/option/open_interest`

### Known Working Endpoints

These endpoints work correctly:
- `/list/expirations` - ✅ Working
- `/list/strikes` - ✅ Working
- `/snapshot/option/quote` - ❌ NO_DATA (market closed)
- `/snapshot/option/ohlc` - ❌ NO_DATA (market closed)

### Recommendations

1. **Test during market hours** - Many endpoints return NO_DATA on weekends
2. **Check subscription status** - Bulk data might require specific subscription tier
3. **Verify Terminal configuration** - Ensure Terminal is configured for bulk data access
4. **Monitor Terminal logs** - Check Terminal logs for more detailed error information

### Code Status

The implementation is complete and follows best practices:
- Consistent naming convention
- Proper async/sync support
- Automatic strike price conversion
- Comprehensive documentation
- Example code provided

The bulk endpoints are ready to use once the data access issues are resolved.
